we use Ref to accesse the realDom world

the use of Ref is when we want to get a state of our element and see our element situation in ref

for example :

```
inputref = React.creatRef()
```

if we want to do autofocus on sth this action rerender our previuos action but if we use ref to focusing it means just hide it and then show it again (not rerendering again).

Components in some changes are rerenduring :
if props changed
if state changed
if parent changed

the pure component is try to stop rendering additional things

pure component in some changes are rerenduring :
if props changed
if state changed

pure component is exactly the component that only has should update component inside of it

HOCs is when we want to control our rendering. 
in HOCs we use one component above the anoder component and we give the component as a props to upper component.

For example we give the permision to the user to render it for admoon or not.
