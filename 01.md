heres some basic things that Ive leasrned from react :

we have a virtualdom and a realdom that reactdom is just transfer my virtualdom to realdom.

babel just transfer my jsx(javascript xml) to js file

Webpack takes your React app's code (JSX, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and:

Bundles everything into a small number of files (often just one).

Transpiles code (e.g., JSX → JavaScript, ES6 → ES5).

Loads assets (images, styles, etc.).

Optimizes code for production (minifies, removes unused code, etc.).

The Command of `npx` is looking for latest version of react and then install react on your system.
