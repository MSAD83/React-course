The second session:

the mounting on component meaning that our project mounted into Dom (realDom) the reactdom compared virtual dom with realdom and the mount it into realdom

When you want to call the parent you need to add

```
super()
```

in your child constructor so that parent is called correctly

if you want to pass the component default value you can do it with `props`

we can make a static default props that when we dont want to pass the props still has a default value:

```
static defaultprops ={
    default value: 0
}
```

If we use `React.StrictMode` for our reactdom in main file we can know whats the problem with warning but the provlem is this command render twice!

we cant have two export defaul in a file

if we use `<child></child>` insted of `</child>`
we can pass the props beatwen them

we need to give a key to every element in our array that we give to react

with `.creatportal` you can render one element without other elements.

if we change the value the input will change bute when the input change the state doesnt change so we add onchange to input to state know that we are changeing the input, so we have a rerender every time

we can callback from privious state like this example:
